# PLP1: History and Hello World
C++ is a general purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup.

## History ## 
C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s with a motivation to add object-oriented programming into the C language. 

C++ is widely used for large software structures and seen in a variety of industries. For example, C++ is used for back-end services of popular web browsers such as  Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera to retrieve database information and render code to interactive webpages. C++ also helps Google search engine render quick search result. 

To learn C++, I will use following resources: 

C++ documentation: https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/

### Installation ###

According to my learning materials, Visual Studio Code supports C++ for both Windows, Linux and MacOS. I installed C/C++ Extension on VSCode. 

For me, I use MacOS with already install compiler for C++.

**Compile with Terminal:** Type `g++` followed by the `.cpp` file name in the terminal and press Enter.
